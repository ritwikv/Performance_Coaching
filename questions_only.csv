3,This is unbelievable! I booked this trip months ago. How could you just cancel my flight like that? I took time off work and made so many plans. This is completely unacceptable!,12345,JaneDoe123,2024-02-01,02:16:43

6,How could you let this happen? I booked my trip so far in advance specifically to avoid problems! Now everything is ruined and I had to waste my time calling you to get this fixed. This is the worst service ever.,12345,JaneDoe123,2024-02-01,02:16:43

8,This has been a terrible experience. You should train your staff better so these problems don't happen. I expect much better service than this if I'm going to book through your company again.,12345,JaneDoe123,2024-02-01,02:16:43
