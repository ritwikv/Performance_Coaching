            "CSR: I'm sorry to hear about the connection issues. Let me help you troubleshoot this. Can you tell me what type of modem you're using?",
            "Customer: It's a Netgear router, about 2 years old. The lights keep blinking red.",
            "CSR: Okay, the red blinking light usually indicates a connection problem. Let's try restarting your modem first. Can you unplug it for 30 seconds and then plug it back in?",
            "Customer: Alright, I've unplugged it. Should I wait exactly 30 seconds?",
            "CSR: Yes, waiting 30 seconds allows the device to fully reset. Now you can plug it back in and wait for the lights to stabilize.",
            "Customer: Okay, it's plugged back in. The lights are cycling through different colors now.",
            "CSR: Perfect! That's normal during the startup process. It should take about 2-3 minutes for all lights to turn solid green. This usually resolves most connection issues.",
            "Customer: Great! The lights are now solid green and my internet seems to be working. Thank you so much for your help!",
            "CSR: You're very welcome! I'm glad we could resolve this quickly. If you experience any more issues, please don't hesitate to call us back. Have a great day!"

            "CSR: Thank you for providing that. Let me pull up your account right now. I can see you've been a valued customer since 2019. I'm looking at your recent bill now. Can you tell me which specific charges you're concerned about?",
            "Customer: There's a $25 service fee and a $15 equipment charge. I never requested any service or new equipment.",
            "CSR: I see those charges on your account. The $25 service fee was applied when a technician visited your location on February 5th to resolve a signal issue. The $15 equipment charge is for a new cable box that was installed during that visit.",
            "Customer: But I never called for a technician! Someone just showed up at my door saying there was a problem in the neighborhood.",
            "CSR: I apologize for the confusion. Let me investigate this further. I can see in our system that this was actually a proactive service call due to area-wide signal issues. You shouldn't have been charged for this since it was our initiative to fix a network problem.",
            "Customer: Exactly! So why am I being charged for something that was your company's problem?",
            "CSR: You're absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for this billing error. I'm going to remove both charges from your account immediately. The $25 service fee and $15 equipment charge will be credited back to your account within 2-3 business days.",
            "Customer: Thank you, that's what I was hoping to hear. Will this affect my service in any way?",
            "CSR: Not at all. Your service will continue normally, and you'll see the $40 credit on your next bill. I'm also adding a note to your account about this situation. Is there anything else I can help you with today?",
            "Customer: No, that resolves my issue. Thank you for taking care of this so quickly.",
            "CSR: You're very welcome! Thank you for being a loyal customer, and again, I apologize for the billing confusion. Have a wonderful day!"
